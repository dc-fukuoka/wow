wow - wake on wan.
=====
how to run
_____
~~~
$ make
$ ./wow <FQDN> <MAC address> <UDP port no>
~~~
_____
note: it does not seem to be possible to wake up from linux to windows...  
so I used cygwin.(send magic packet from windows(cygwin) to windows), it works fine.  
off course, some router/OS/BIOS settings are required to achieve it!
