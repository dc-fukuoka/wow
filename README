wow - wake on wan.
      this is for my pc.

$ make
$ ./wow <FQDN> <MAC> <UDP port>

note: it does not seem to be possible to wake up from linux to windows...
so I used cygwin.(send magic packet from windows(cygwin) to windows), it works fine.
off course, some router settings and OS/BIOS settings are required to achieve it!
